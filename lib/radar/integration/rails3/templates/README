Radar has been setup for this Rails 3 project! BUT...

Some manual work you must complete before Radar is completely prepared:

  * Open `config/initializers/radar.rb` and add at least one reporter to
    the Radar application so Radar knows how you'd like your exceptions
    handled. Example (this would go in the block in that file):

      app.config.reporters.use :file

Once a reporter is added, Radar has already been setup to integrate with
Rails 3, so you may use your application like normal.
