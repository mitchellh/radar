# Support

Learning to use a new tool isn't always the easiest thing. If you need
help, there is a helpful community waiting to answer your questions.

* `#vagrant` on freenode IRC is where I usually hang out. (Radar was
  extracted from [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com))
* [GitHub Issues](http://github.com/mitchellh/radar/issues) if you'd
  like to report a bug, request a feature, or just leave a message.
